## COVID-19 VACCINE FAQs

---

### Who is currently eligible for a Vaccine in the U.S.?

The CDC issues [federal recommendations on vaccine eligibility priority, and who should be part of each eligibility group](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations-process.html). However, actual eligibility for the vaccine is decided by each state. A state will then set its own state-level rollout plan, which in most cases applies for every vaccine in the state.

For a few states, such as Idaho and California, the State gives counties limited abilities to interpret state guidelines and progress along their vaccination phases independently.

### How do I know if I'm eligible for a vaccine in my state?

Check the FindYourVaccine site for your state, which should have up-to-date information from your state's official COVID-19 vaccination website. A full list of each state's official websites can be found in a drop-down menu on the [CDC's COVID-19 vaccine portal here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html).

### If I'm eligible, how do I sign up for a vaccine in my state?

Check the FindYourVaccine website for your state for guidance, and search the map for your nearest vaccination site. Many states have their own vaccination locator website; however, in nearly every state, you will be asked to sign up for an appointment directly with each vaccine provider. The FindYourVaccine team does its best to keep each state page up-to-date with the current list of vaccine providers.

### What should I expect at my vaccine appointment?

[Check these CDC guidelines on what to expect before, during, and after your vaccine appointment.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html)

### Is the vaccine free?

The cost of the vaccine itself is covered by the CARES Act; [however, as noted on the CDC facts page, providers have the ability to charge an administration fee for providing the vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Vaccine%20doses%20purchased%20with%20US,the%20shot%20to%20someone.):

>> "Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. However, vaccination providers can charge an administration fee for giving someone the shot. Vaccination providers can be reimbursed for this by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay the vaccine administration fee."

### How are vaccines allocated to each state?

Vaccine allocation to each state is managed by the Federal Government - specifically, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. [Find more information about the HHS vaccination allocation and distribution plan here](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/distribution/index.html).

### Where we get our data:

Our data comes directly from the official COVID-19 vaccine portals for each U.S. state and territory. This includes each state's current vaccine rollout plan and active eligible population groups. [The CDC's list of these state portals can be found here](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html).

Our list of vaccine provider sites and locations comes from these official state portals, as well as applicable local jurisdiction portals (regional/county/municipality).

Our updates on current appointment and vaccine availability status at each location comes from regular phone and email-based volunteer outreach to individual provider sites. All updates include the date/timestamp of the most recent check-in.

### Is there an official national database of all vaccine providers operating in all the state?

Not yet! That's one of the big reasons we got started. We look forward to supporting any federal government effort to catalogue and sync up national vaccine providers.

### Are there any other non-governmental efforts happening to provide vaccine information for certain states?

Yes! We applaud the teams behind the excellent sites below, and encourage you to visit and support their efforts:

- [Vaccinate CA](http://www.vaccinateca.com)
- [Covid 19 Vaccine TX](http://www.covid19vaccinetx.com)
