### ABOUT US

We are a group of volunteers - Educators, Tech, & Healthcare Professionals - working to pull together clear, accurate COVID-19 vaccine information for the general public as quickly as possible.

The FindYourVaccine team is working hard to expand coverage to additional U.S. states and territories. Please check back regularly for new additions, or [follow us on Twitter @findyourvaccine](https://twitter.com/findyourvaccine) for the latest updates.


### HOW THIS HELPS

Answers to vaccine eligibility and availability are hard to find in many states. Rollout strategies are still fragmented and rapidly changing.

By aggregating the best resources, vaccine availability updates, and state guidance, we can help everyone find the answers they need faster. This also reduces strain on the system, avoiding the need for everyone to contact dozens of providers and hotlines themselves.


### WHERE WE GET OUR DATA

Our data comes directly from the official COVID-19 vaccine portals for each U.S. state and territory. This includes each state's current vaccine rollout plan and active eligible population groups. The CDC's list of state health portals can be found here.

Our list of vaccine provider sites and locations comes from these official state portals, as well as applicable local jurisdiction portals (regional/county/municipality).

Our updates on current appointment and vaccine availability status at each location comes from regular phone- and email- volunteer outreach to individual provider sites. All updates include the date/timestamp of the most recent check-in.


### HOW TO GET INVOLVED

Join us! We are a volunteer-based team. [Please reach out to us on the contact form, and indicate your interest in one or more of the open roles.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGb49aeBfUVZEclKEtj9NYEYPC5UkVIBdNO3gY5y0WWaQkpw/viewform) As opportunities become available to support our efforts, they will be placed below:

- **Outreach Coordinator**: You take responsibility for coordinating the daily calling efforts for one or more states. You have a passion for organization, you keep the train moving, and you love to build a team. You are available for an estimate  of 30 minutes to 1 hr per day.

- **Outreach Volunteer**: You are the heart of this thing! You are matched with one or more state outreach coordinators, and you contact vaccine providers within that state for their current status updates. Your real-time updates go right onto the site. Preference will be given to folks who can commit to daily update sessions.

- **Social Media Manager**: We are seeking one or more people with social media management experience to establish and run our social media presence. This includes our Twitter and Facebook presence, as well as any other platform engagements deemed necessary.

- **Media/PR Coordinator**: We are seeking someone with Media and PR experience to manage media inquiries, press releases, interviews and other journalism engagements.


A note on roles and opportunities: We understand the challenge in taking on these roles on a volunteer basis. This is a community-driven project, and an experiment in what kind of resourcing we all can provide for the general public when the need arises. We will work hard to meet you where you are, and we appreciate every minute you give in support of the team.
