### ABOUT US

We are a group of volunteers - Educators, Tech, & Healthcare Professionals - working to pull together clear, accurate COVID-19 vaccine information for the general public as quickly as possible.
<br /><br />
The FindYourVaccine team is working hard to expand coverage to additional U.S. states and territories. Please check back regularly for new additions, or [follow us on Twitter @findyourvaccine](https://twitter.com/findyourvaccine) for the latest updates.
<br /><br />

### WHERE WE GET OUR DATA

Our data comes directly from the official COVID-19 vaccine portals for each U.S. state and territory. This includes each state's current vaccine rollout plan and active eligible population groups. The CDC's list of state health portals can be found here.
<br /><br />
Our list of vaccine provider sites and locations comes from these official state portals, as well as applicable local jurisdiction portals (regional/county/municipality).
<br /><br />
Our updates on current appointment and vaccine availability status at each location comes from regular phone- and email- volunteer outreach to individual provider sites. All updates include the date/timestamp of the most recent check-in.
<br /><br />
